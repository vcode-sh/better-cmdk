## What is better-cmdk?

**better-cmdk** is a React component library for building command palettes with built-in AI chat. It extends [cmdk](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk) with streaming AI conversations, tool approval workflows, and dynamic form rendering — all styled with Tailwind CSS v4 and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) design system.

## How it works

better-cmdk provides two main modes:

**Command mode** — Users press `⌘K` to open a fuzzy-searchable command palette. Define groups of commands with keyboard shortcuts and icons.

**Chat mode** — When no commands match (or the user presses `⌘Enter`), the palette switches to an AI conversation. Messages stream in real-time. The AI can suggest actions that require user approval, render forms, and execute tools.

```tsx
import { CommandMenu, CommandMenuInput, CommandMenuList, CommandMenuEmpty } from "better-cmdk";

<CommandMenu open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} chatEndpoint="/api/chat">
  <CommandMenuInput placeholder="Search or ask AI..." showSendButton />
  <CommandMenuList>
    <CommandMenuEmpty />
    {/* Your command groups here */}
  </CommandMenuList>
</CommandMenu>
```

## Architecture

better-cmdk supports two integration patterns:

| Pattern | How it works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Built-in chat** | Pass `chatEndpoint="/api/chat"` — better-cmdk handles streaming internally using `useChat()` from the Vercel AI SDK |
| **External chat** | Pass a `chat` prop with the `ExternalChat` interface to connect your own chat system or agent platform like [modifywithai.com](https://modifywithai.com) |

With either approach, you can define **actions** — the specific operations available in your app (e.g. "toggle dark mode", "navigate to page"). These actions appear as searchable commands and can be invoked by the AI agent through [modifywithai.com](https://modifywithai.com) or your own backend.
